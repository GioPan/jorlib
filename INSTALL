INSTALL

## Using jORLib as a dependency in your project ##
Simply download jORLib from the releases page. Import the jar jorlib-core.jar and its dependencies into your project.

## Running jORLib demo's ##
The demo's can be run directly from the command line.
1. Download jORLib from the releases page, as well as the necessary data files in the release package.
2. Running the code (version numbering needs to be adjusted accordingly):
  a. Algorithmic example (SubtourSeparatorDemo): java -cp jorlib-demo-1.0-uber.jar org.jorlib.demo.alg.tsp.separation.SubtourSeparatorDemo
  b. Column Generation example (this requires a working Cplex installation): java -Djava.library.path=/opt/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1261/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/ -cp jorlib-demo-1.0-uber.jar org.jorlib.demo.frameworks.columnGeneration.bapExample.TSPSolver

## Importing jORLib as a Maven project in Eclipse/IntelliJ ##
1. Download all project files from the release page. Alternatively, download the sources directly from github.
2. OPTIONAL: if you plan on running the Column Generation/Branch-and-Price test suite or demo's, make sure that Cplex is installed. Two alternative options exist (choose one).
  a. Add cplex.jar (located under cplex/lib in your Cplex Studio installation folder) to your local maven repository, e.g.:
     mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=cplex -DartifactId=cplex -Dversion=12.6.1 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/opt/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1261/cplex/lib/cplex.jar
  b. You can proceed to step 3 first, and add cplex.jar later as a library to your project manually
3. Through your favorite IDE (e.g. IntelliJ or Eclipse), import the pom.xml file from jORLib's root directory. For IntelliJ, ensure that recursive project detection is enabled.
4. OPTIONAL: if you plan on running the Column Generation/Branch-and-Price test suite or demo's, you need to point the LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviromental variable to Cplex' native libraries.
   In IntelliJ, the easiest way to do this by opening Module Settings (F4)->Libraries. Select the Cplex library you've added in step 2, click the 'add' button (green plus), and add the path pointing to
   the native libraries, e.g. /opt/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1261/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/. Click apply and you are done.
